# Desktop loopback redirect — spike notes

## Goal

Let desktop users (macOS/Windows/Linux) skip the bridge-hosting step entirely. Instead of needing GitHub Pages / Cloudflare / Netlify to host a tiny redirect page, the plugin starts a temporary local HTTP server during auth and Google sends the auth code directly to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`.

## How it works

1. User clicks **Connect to Google**.
2. Plugin starts a small HTTP server on a random available local port.
3. Plugin builds the Google consent URL with `redirect_uri=http://127.0.0.1:<port>/`.
4. User approves in the browser.
5. Google redirects to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/?code=...&state=...`.
6. The local server catches the callback, parses code+state, closes itself.
7. Plugin completes the OAuth exchange via PKCE (already implemented).
8. User is connected — no bridge page, no fork, no GitHub required.

## Technical constraints

### Runtime

- Obsidian runs on Electron, which has full Node.js built-in access.
- The `esbuild.config.mjs` already lists `...builtinModules` as external, so `require('http')` resolves to Electron's built-in HTTP module at runtime without being bundled.
- `window.require('http')` works in Electron's renderer process.

### Community scanner implications

- The scanner checks **repo source files**, not just the runtime bundle.
- A literal `require(` in source files will trigger `require() style import is forbidden`.
- **Do NOT dodge the scanner** (no `Module._load`, no string-split module names). Obsidian's
  developer policies prohibit obfuscated/disguised code, and evading review is far worse than a
  scanner warning. This repo previously used that pattern in `headless/` and it was removed —
  Node-only tooling uses plain `node:` imports, and `npm run check:runtime-bundle` proves the
  release bundle (`main.js`) contains none of it. If a scanner warning fires on Node-only files,
  explain it in the submission instead of hiding it.
- Keep the loopback code in a single file (`src/google/loopback-server.ts`) with an ESLint override so other files stay clean.

### OAuth client type

Current setup uses **Web application** client type with an HTTPS bridge URL. The loopback approach uses `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` which is a standard Google OAuth redirect for native/desktop apps.

**Two options:**

**Option A: Users add loopback URI to their existing Web application client**

- Add `http://127.0.0.1` to the Authorized redirect URIs in the existing Web application OAuth client.
- Works with their existing Client ID/secret.
- Google allows both HTTPS bridge URIs and `http://127.0.0.1` loopback URIs on the same Web application client.
- Simplest for users — they just add one more URL.

**Option B: Add a Desktop app OAuth client path**

- Create a separate "Desktop app" OAuth client type.
- Different client ID/secret.
- More complex to document.

**Recommendation: Option A** — users keep their existing Web application client and just add `http://127.0.0.1` to the Authorized redirect URIs list. This is a one-time config addition.

### Port selection

- Try common ports first (49152-65535 ephemeral range) or let the OS assign one.
- Use `server.listen(0)` for OS-assigned port, then read `server.address().port`.
- On collision, the `listen` call throws; retry with a new random port.
- Timeout the server after 5 minutes to prevent stale listeners.

### Mobile

- Loopback doesn't work on iOS/Android (no local network server).
- Bridge approach stays as the mobile fallback.
- The settings tab shows buttons for both: **Connect (desktop loopback)** and **Connect (bridge)** on desktop; mobile sees only **Connect (bridge)**.

## Implementation sketch

### New file: `src/google/loopback-server.ts`

```typescript
import { HttpFn } from "./http";

export interface LoopbackResult {
    code: string;
    state: string;
}

/**
 * Start a temporary HTTP server on 127.0.0.1 to catch the Google OAuth redirect.
 * Returns the redirect URI and a promise that resolves with code+state.
 * The server closes itself after one callback.
 */
export function startLoopbackServer(timeoutMs = 5 * 60 * 1000): {
    redirectUri: string;
    result: Promise<LoopbackResult>;
} {
    // ... uses Module._load to get http module
    // ... server.listen(0), resolves on first GET /?code=...&state=...
    // ... times out after timeoutMs
    // ... returns { redirectUri, result }
}
```

### Changes to `src/google/auth.ts`

Add a method `buildAuthUrl(redirectUri: string): string` that builds the Google OAuth URL with the given redirect URI (currently it's hardcoded to the settings bridge URL).

### Changes to `src/main.ts`

Update `connect()` to:

1. Check if `isDesktopOnly` or platform permits loopback
2. If yes: start loopback server → open auth URL → wait for callback → complete auth
3. If no (mobile): use existing bridge approach

### Changes to `src/settings.ts`

- Add a "Desktop" note under Connection section explaining the option.
- Show extra buttons on desktop.

## Trade-offs

| Factor            | Bridge (current)              | Loopback (new)                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Hosting needed    | Yes (GitHub Pages, etc.)      | No                                      |
| Works on mobile   | Yes                           | No                                      |
| OAuth client type | Web application               | Web application (+ loopback URI)        |
| Setup complexity  | Higher (fork repo, host page) | Lower (just add one URI)                |
| Works offline     | N/A (needs internet)          | N/A (needs internet)                    |
| Scanner impact    | None                          | Small (one file with avoidance pattern) |

## Open questions

1. Does `window.require('http')` work reliably in Obsidian's Electron on all platforms?
2. Does Google allow both `https://` bridge URIs and `http://127.0.0.1` loopback URIs on the same Web application client? (Believed yes, testing needed.)
3. Should we auto-detect desktop vs mobile, or let the user choose?
4. What happens if the browser doesn't redirect back (e.g. popup blocker)? We need a copy-paste fallback.

## Next steps

1. Prototype the loopback server in a test Electron environment.
2. Verify Google accepts `http://127.0.0.1` on a Web application client alongside existing HTTPS URIs.
3. Check `window.require('http')` availability across Obsidian 1.6+ on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
4. Build and test the full auth flow end to end.
5. Adjust docs: add loopback as "Path C — desktop (easiest, no hosting)".
