# Google Calendar and Tasks Sync

Keep your Obsidian notes in sync with **Google Calendar** and **Google Tasks** — on desktop and mobile.

This plugin is for people who like planning in Markdown but still want their calendar and task list available everywhere Google works.

## What it syncs

- 📅 Notes in **`events/`** become Google Calendar events.
- ✅ Notes in **`tasks/`** become Google Tasks.
- Editing a synced note updates Google.
- Deleting or renaming a synced note updates Google.
- Google events/tasks can be imported into your vault.
- Past events and old tasks can be tidied into archive/overdue/completed folders.

## Important sync model

This is intentionally conservative so it does not destroy local edits:

- **Obsidian → Google:** automatic while Obsidian is open, if the matching sync-on-create/modify/delete settings are enabled.
- **Google → Obsidian:** manual via **Import events and tasks from Google**.
- **Google → Obsidian on startup:** optional and off by default. When enabled, it only creates new missing notes and does **not** overwrite existing notes.

If you need a full two-way merge workflow, test carefully with a spare calendar/list first.

## Import settings

When pulling from Google (manual import or import-on-startup), these settings keep the volume sane and stop your vault filling with thousands of notes:

- **Import window — days past / days ahead:** only events inside this window are imported. Defaults are **7 days past** and **90 days ahead**. Recurring events are expanded into one note per occurrence, so a wide window pulls a lot of notes — widen it deliberately.
- **Recurring event filter:** controls which repeating events (lectures, standups, weekly 1:1s) get imported. One-off events are always imported.
    - **Allowlist** (default): import only recurring events whose title matches one of your patterns. An **empty allowlist imports no recurring events** — this is the strict default, so add titles to opt them in.
    - **Blocklist:** import every recurring event _except_ those whose title matches. An empty blocklist imports them all.
- **Recurring event titles:** one title per line, with `*` as a wildcard (e.g. `Weekly*`, `Standup*`). Used by whichever mode is selected above. Matching is case-insensitive.

These only affect what is _imported from_ Google. Notes you author locally always sync up regardless of these settings.

## Install

### From Obsidian Community Plugins

1. Open Obsidian.
2. Go to **Settings → Community plugins**.
3. Turn off **Restricted mode** if needed.
4. Select **Browse**.
5. Search for **Google Calendar and Tasks Sync**.
6. Select **Install**, then **Enable**.

### Manual install (GitHub release)

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the latest GitHub release.
2. In your vault, create:

    ```text
    .obsidian/plugins/google-sync/
    ```

3. Put the three downloaded files in that folder.
4. Restart Obsidian.
5. Go to **Settings → Community plugins** and enable **Google Calendar and Tasks Sync**.

## First-time setup

The plugin needs your own Google OAuth client. This avoids any shared hosted backend and keeps Google tokens in your vault’s local plugin data.

Follow the full guide here:

- [Google setup guide](https://github.com/Cordedmink2/obsidian-google-sync/blob/main/docs/google-setup.md)

Short version:

1. Create or choose a Google Cloud project.
2. Enable **Google Calendar API** and **Google Tasks API**.
3. Configure the OAuth consent screen.
4. Host the tiny redirect bridge page included in this repo.
5. Create a **Web application** OAuth client.
6. Paste the client ID, client secret, and bridge URL into the plugin settings.
7. Run **Connect to Google** from Obsidian’s command palette.
8. Run **Validate setup**.

## Optional: Templater workflow (recommended)

If you use the **Templater** community plugin, you can auto-insert valid event/task frontmatter when creating new notes.

- Full guide: [Templater setup](https://github.com/Cordedmink2/obsidian-google-sync/blob/main/docs/templater-setup.md)
- Quick install link: `obsidian://show-plugin?id=templater-obsidian`
- One-command scaffold:

```bash
./scripts/setup-templater.sh /path/to/your/vault --configure-templater
```

This creates event/task templates and can auto-configure Templater’s template folder + trigger-on-create setting.

Then add folder mappings in Obsidian Templater:

- `events` → `templates/google-sync/event-template.md`
- `tasks` → `templates/google-sync/task-template.md`

Quick smoke test from terminal:

```bash
./scripts/verify-setup.sh /path/to/your/vault
./scripts/bootstrap-sample-notes.sh /path/to/your/vault
```

## Commands

Open Obsidian’s command palette and search for these commands:

- **Connect to Google** — sign in once and store Google tokens in the plugin data file.
- **Sync now** — push matching Obsidian notes to Google.
- **Import events and tasks from Google** — pull Google items into your vault. By default it only imports the configured calendar and task list, within the import window, to avoid vault spam. Recurring events are filtered by the allowlist/blocklist (see [Import settings](#import-settings)).
- **Run lifecycle scan** — move past events to `events/archive/`, overdue tasks to `tasks/overdue/`, and completed tasks to `tasks/completed/`.
- **Test connection** — quick Google connectivity check.
- **Validate setup** — checks OAuth settings, Google connection, selected calendar, and selected task list.
- **Disconnect from Google** — remove stored Google tokens.

## Folder layout

The defaults are:

```text
events/
events/archive/
tasks/
tasks/overdue/
tasks/completed/
```

You can change the folder names in plugin settings before you start syncing.

## Event note example

Create a Markdown file under `events/`:

```yaml
---
title: Coffee with Alex
date: 2026-06-02T10:00
end: 2026-06-02T11:00
timezone: Pacific/Auckland
location: Wellington
description: Catch-up about Q3 plan
status: confirmed
visibility: default
eventType: meeting
color: "7"
guestsCanInviteOthers: true
guestsCanModify: false
guestsCanSeeOtherGuests: true
reminders:
    useDefault: false
    overrides:
        - method: popup
          minutes: 10
attendees:
    required:
        - alex@example.com
    optional:
        -
---
Notes for myself stay here, in Obsidian.
```

After syncing, the plugin writes a `googleId` field into the frontmatter. Leave that field alone; it is how the plugin knows which Google event belongs to the note.

## Task note example

Create a Markdown file under `tasks/`:

```yaml
---
title: Buy milk
due: 2026-06-01
completed: false
---
Optional task notes go here.
```

Set `completed: true` and sync to mark the task completed in Google Tasks. With **Auto-archive past events** on, completing a task also files it into `tasks/completed/` straight away — you no longer have to wait for the periodic lifecycle scan.

## Linking tasks to events

You can link task notes to an event so they are completed in Google Tasks automatically when the event passes (and gets archived). On the **event** note, add a `tasks:` list:

```yaml
tasks:
    - "[[Pack bags for malaysia]]"
    - "[[Buy travel adapter]]"
```

Entries can be Obsidian wikilinks (so they also show up in the graph) or plain note basenames — both work. When the event is archived (its date is more than the configured days in the past), each linked task is marked completed in Google Tasks. Requires **Auto-archive past events** and **Auto-close linked tasks on archive** to be on.

## Obsidian-friendly notes

- Notes use standard YAML frontmatter (Obsidian **Properties**) plus a Markdown body, so wiki links, tags, and embeds work normally.
- **Importing from Google is non-destructive to your own metadata.** It updates only the fields it manages (title, date, due, etc.); the note body and any extra properties you add (tags, `[[wiki links]]`, your own fields, the event `tasks` list) are preserved across re-imports.

## Privacy and safety

- The plugin talks directly to Google Calendar and Google Tasks using Obsidian’s `requestUrl` API.
- It does not include analytics or telemetry.
- Google OAuth tokens are stored by Obsidian in the plugin’s vault-local `data.json`.
- Your OAuth client secret is also stored in plugin settings. Treat the vault’s `.obsidian/plugins/google-sync/data.json` as private.
- The plugin only manages notes inside the configured event/task folders.
- Startup Google import is off by default and additions-only when enabled.

## Troubleshooting

- Run **Validate setup** first. It gives the clearest checklist of what is missing.
- If login does not return to Obsidian, check that your Google OAuth redirect URI exactly matches your hosted bridge URL.
- If a note does not sync, check that it is under the configured `events/` or `tasks/` folder and has the required frontmatter fields.
- If event times look wrong, add an explicit `timezone` such as `Pacific/Auckland`.
- Task `due` dates are date-only in Google Tasks. The plugin preserves the calendar date you set (no off-by-one in timezones ahead of UTC); upgrade to 0.1.13+ if "due tomorrow" ever showed as today.
- If imported notes get overwritten back to a template (e.g. `title: Event title`), see the Templater warning in the [Templater setup guide](https://github.com/Cordedmink2/obsidian-google-sync/blob/main/docs/templater-setup.md) — don't pair folder templates + trigger-on-creation with Import from Google.
- Test with a spare Google calendar/task list before using important real data.
